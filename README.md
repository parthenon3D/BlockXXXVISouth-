# Block XXXVI South Frieze

Marble relief (Block XXXVI) from the South frieze of the Parthenon. The frieze shows the procession of the Panathenaic festival, the commemoration of the birthday of the goddess Athena. Ahead of the chariots, there appeared groups of draped pedestrian figures. In the North frieze these comprised elders, musicians, pitcher bearers, tray bearers and figures leading animals as sacrificial victims.
